                    <h2>DEVELOPER</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I'm Faith, a passionate web developer with a knack for creating innovative and user-friendly websites. Seeking an entry-level position to leverage my technical skills and contribute to a dynamic team.
                        With a strong background in programming, problem-solving skills, a passion for developing efficient scalable software solutions and a keen eye for design, I strive to deliver high-quality web solutions that meet the needs of my clients.</p>
                    <h2>Professional Background</h2>
                    <p>With a strong foundation in Web developing principles and a passion for innovative technology, I have dedicated myself to crafting dynamic and responsive websites. My freelance journey began with a focus on web development, where I specialized in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create user-friendly interfaces. My recent projects include:
                        Developing a therapy-themed survey form that aims to enhance user experience and data collection efficiency.
                        Designing visually appealing websites with a preference for red and black color schemes to align with my clients' branding needs.
                        Assisting clients with CSS and website styling to ensure their online presence is both professional and engaging.
                        As I prepare to further my education in software engineering, I am also exploring the realm of Human-Robot Interaction. My goal is to integrate my web development expertise with my interest in robotics, creating seamless interactions between humans and robots. Whether it's through gaming, physical activities, or nature exploration, I envision a future where robots can coexist and feel alongside humans.</p>
